# Frontend Mentor – Profile Card Component

This project is a solution to the [Profile Card Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) on Frontend Mentor. It helped me practice positioning background images and creating responsive card layouts.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal was to create a centered profile card with two decorative background shapes positioned at opposite corners. Ensuring the shapes stayed partially visible and balanced on different screen sizes was the main design challenge.

## 💡 What I Practiced

- Positioning background images using `background-position` and `background-size`
- Centering content vertically and horizontally
- Ensuring a clean, responsive layout using plain HTML and CSS

> I’m still unsure if my background placement method is optimal across all devices and might revisit it later.

## 🛠️ Built With
